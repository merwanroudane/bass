Description
أساسيات القياس الاقتصادي is an interactive Streamlit application designed as an introductory guide for economics students in Algeria. It walks learners through the core steps of applied econometrics—from exploring and visualizing data to estimating and diagnosing linear regression models—using Arabic-language explanations and “street-style” tips to keep things engaging.

Key features include:

Data Upload & Preview
Load your own Excel or CSV datasets and view summary tables on-the-fly.

Descriptive Statistics & Plots
Compute means, variances, and percentiles; display line charts, boxplots, and heatmap correlations.

Regression Analysis
Fit OLS, Ridge and Lasso models, display coefficients with 95% confidence intervals, and interpret parameter estimates in Arabic.

Model Diagnostics
Check residual normality (Q-Q plots, Shapiro–Wilk), multicollinearity (VIF), and heteroskedasticity (Breusch–Pagan test).

Interactive Visualizations
Leverage Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for dynamic charts that help illustrate key econometric concepts.

Export Results
Download tables and figures directly as Excel sheets or image files for reports and presentations.

This app is meant purely as an educational reference. It’s fully open-source, easy to extend, and built with common Python packages so you can customize it to your own courses or research projects.
